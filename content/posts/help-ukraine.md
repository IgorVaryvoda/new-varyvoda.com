Russia is waging an unprovoked and vicious war against Ukraine. Millions of people got displaced, tens of thousands of people lost their loved ones and once beautiful Ukrainian cities are getting razed to the ground.

Barbaric Russian occupiers are facing fierce resistance from Ukrainians, who are not willing to lose their independence, culture, national identity and their lives to pathetic Russian imperialism.

I, like millions of other Ukrainians, cannot stay idle in this situation.

I've created [UAHelp.me](https://www.uahelp.me) - a curated list of resources to help Ukraine and its people. Here's how you can help Ukraine:

## Help the Ukrainian army
Helping the armed forces of Ukraine is one of the most meaningful ways of contributing to Ukrainian victory. The sooner the Ukrainians crush Russians  the sooner the suffering ends.

Without additional weaponry, Russo-Ukrainian war will become an endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction. Please pressure your politicians into providing aid to Ukraine. [Here's the list of what Ukraine Needs](https://saveualist.com/).
