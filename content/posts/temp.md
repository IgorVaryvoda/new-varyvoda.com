## Forget the bridge
Just forget about it, I've never seen anyone do a smooth transtition from Nuxt2 to Nuxt3 using the bridge, there's weird issues, the documentation doesn't cover everything and yeah, just forget about it and go with a fresh nuxt3 install.

## Install nuxt3 
Self-explanatory, just install it, instructions and shit will be here when I have internet.

## Convert the config file
The syntax is similar, but there are differences. I think there are tools that allow you to convert this shit. maybe I'll find them, this is honestly not the hardest part of the process.

## Add in your pages and components one by one. 
This could be a tough one.

## Popular libs and their nuxt3 equivalents

## the nice to haves
