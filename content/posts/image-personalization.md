### The original article was posted on [Sirv's blog](https://sirv.com/blog/image-personalization-examples/)


Personalization has become one of the hottest marketing trends.

Nowadays, shoppers want not only products ‚Äì they want better experiences. That‚Äôs what makes them come back for more.<!--more-->

   But there's one thing that hasn't had enough attention in this wild personalization ride:  <strong>Images!</strong>

 Chat with our little friend below to learn how image personalization can help your business.

   <h3 id="why" class="hiddenh">Why personalize?</h3>
   <h2 id="why" class="js-toc-ignore" data-toc-title="Why personalize?">Personalization has a positive effect on customer relationships, engagement and conversion rate</h2>

   Marketers who use personalization in their marketing strategy almost unanimously agree that it has a positive effect on advancing customer relationships.

   In fact, according to an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.evergage.com/resources/ebooks/trends-in-personalization-survey-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evergage survey</a>, 74% believe personalization has a strong or extreme impact.

   Here's a detailed breakdown:
    <h4>What is the impact, if any, of personalization on advancing customer relationships?</h4>
    <div class="max-width:800px;">
   <img src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/stats/RelationShips%20impact.svg" alt="image personalization impact">

   The benefits are evident.
          <h4>What are the main benefits you see from personalization for your organization?</h4>
   <div style="max-width:800px!important;">
   <img src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/stats/PersonalizationResults.svg" alt="image personalization benefits">

   And the results speak for themselves.

   <h4>What percentage improvement or ‚Äúlift‚Äù are you generally seeing from personalization efforts?</h4>
   <div style="max-width:800px!important;">
          <img src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/stats/QuantifiableResults.svg" alt="image personalization results">
   </div>

   It's clear that personalization is effective.

   Let's move on to the important part: how to use personalized images.

   <h2 style="text-align:center" id="email" data-toc-title="Personalization in email">Image personalization in email</h2>
   <div class="full-image__container marginize">
      <div class="full-image--center">
          <img class="Sirv" alt="image personalization in email" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/Email_section2x.png?text.0.text=Hello%20Tom&text.0.position.x=68%&text.0.position.y=22%&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.size=15&text.0.color=5cb1f7&text.0.font.family=Pompiere&w=1600">
      </div>
      </div>
   Email is the most widely used channel for personalized content. Let's be honest, practically everybody uses some sort of merge tags in their email campaigns, so text personalization lost its WOW effect long ago.

   With email open and click rates dropping dramatically in the last couple of years, image personalization has become a powerful tool for keeping email campaigns effective.

   Here's a couple of examples that've mastered it.

   <h3 id="dicount"style="text-align:center;">Discount email</h3>
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
     <img alt="Thorntons image personalization email example" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Santa_Good_Boy.png?text.0.text=Tom&text.0.position.x=41%&text.0.position.y=64%&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.color=c51717&text.0.font.family=Marck%20Script&&text.0.font.size=30px">
     <p class="wp-caption-text">An example campaign from Thorntons</p>
   </div>
   Santa's nice list sounds like a pretty good place to be. It takes a little bit of image personalization to go from a dull discount email to something more meaningful and fun.

   <h3 id="promo" style="text-align:center;">Promotional email</h3>
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="Starbucks image personalization email example" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Starbucks%202.jpg?text.0.text=Tom&text.0.position=center&text.0.size=25&text.0.color=060606&text.0.font.family=Caveat">
   <p class="wp-caption-text">Yes, it's a name on a Starbucks coffee. If you've talked to our bot - it's your name on a Starbucks coffee, hehe.</p>
   </div>
   This one kind of takes you back to your favorite Starbucks with that fresh cup of coffee with your name on it. Mmmm.

   <h3 id="cart-abandonment" style="text-align:center;">Cart abandonment</h3>

   <a target="_blank" href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stats don't lie</a>, almost 70% of all carts are abandoned. Sprinkle just a little bit of personalization into your abandoned cart emails and see what happens (hint: it'll be great).

   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="Chubbies shorts image personalization email example" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/chubbies_d37b2775-b52f-48e1-9b56-5eff5ed2bbf8.png?text.0.text=Tom, click to teleport&text.0.position.x=22%25&text.0.position.y=65%25&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.size=60&text.0.color=fafafa&text.0.font.weight=700&text.0.outline.width=3&text.0.outline.color=ffffff&text.0.background.color=black&text.0.background.opacity=50" />
   <p class="wp-caption-text">A cart abandonment campaign from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chubbiesshorts.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chubbies Shorts</a>. We added image personalization ourselves though.</p>
   </div>

   Great copy + a crisp personalized image = a perfect combination to recover an abandoned cart.

   <h3 id="cold-as-ice" style="text-align:center;">Cold email</h3>
   Image personalization isn't limited to a name.

   <a target="_blank" href="https://fullstory.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a> used website screenshots of their leads with a "play" button overlay. It makes a lot of sense, since FullStory's service is built entirely on recording visitor activity on your website.
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="Fullstory image personalization cold email example"src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Cold_email.png">
   <p class="wp-caption-text">FullStory used website image screenshots of their potential customers in their email. </p>
   </div>
   This email impressed Kyle Racki so much that he even created a blog post about it called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.proposify.com/blog/the-best-cold-email" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Cold Email I Ever Received</a>.

   PS: It's not hard to automate this process.

   <h3 id="newsletter" style="text-align:center;">Newsletter</h3>

   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="Really Good Emails Newsletter image personalization email example" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/RGE.png?text.0.text=Tom&text.0.position.x=59%25&text.0.position.y=46.9%25&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.font.size=13px&text.0.color=eb4d52&text.0.font.weight=700"/>
   <p class="wp-caption-text">Really Good Emails newsletter</p>
   </div>
   Those guys know what they're doing. We highly recommend subscribing to <a target="_blank" href="https://reallygoodemails.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Really Good Emails newsletter</a> for great email marketing insights. They've been using image personalization for a long time, and it looks amazing.


   <h3 id="event" style="text-align:center;">Event email</h3>
   Not only does <a target="_blank" href="https://www.movember.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Movember</a> have a very noble cause, they're taking it to another level with great copy and a snappy personalized image.
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="Movember image personalization email example" src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/movember_edited.jpg?text.0.text=Tom&text.0.position.x=40%&text.0.position.y=133px&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.color=white&text.0.font.weight=700&text.0.outline.color=f3ecb2&text.0.outline.width=1&&text.0.font.family=Kalam"/>
   <p class="wp-caption-text">With a rebel yell she cried mo, mo, mo!</p>
   </div>
   Good job, Movember people. There's nothing Mo you can do to beat this.

   <h3 id="survey" style="text-align:center;">Survey emails</h3>
   It's pretty hard to get people to take a survey without an incentive.

   A nice personalized image might change the odds in your favor:
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img class="Sirv" alt="Wirecutter image personalization email example" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/wirecutter.png?text.0.text=Hey%20Tom%2C%0AGot%20a%20minute%3F&text.0.position.x=10%&text.0.position.y=25%&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.size=45&text.0.color=000000&text.0.font.weight=800" />
   <p class="wp-caption-text">Wirecutter. Again, we added a little bit of personal touch to this with the name.</p>
   </div>

   <h2 id="how" data-toc-title="How to personalize email campaigns">How to personalize email campaigns</h2>
   Looks cool? Here's how you can do it.

   It's quite simple since most marketing automation/email providers and personalization platforms support custom fields of some sort.

   You'll need two things:
   <ul>
   <li>Image personalization software</li>
   <li>Data</li>
   </ul>
   For <strong>image personalization</strong>, you can use Sirv. It's our blog, so no surprises here, right? :)

   If you‚Äôve played with our bot, you can see that all images on this page are personalized with your name.

   Here's how it works. Sirv generates images on-the-fly, based on the parameters you pass to the URL. It might sound complicated, but it's not. Here's an example, hover over the bold elements for explanation.
   <code><span class="highlighter" data-avia-tooltip="This is the path to our image in Sirv.">https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Starbucks%202.jpg</span>?<span class="highlighter" data-avia-tooltip="This parameter adds text to the image. Use your *name* variable here. E.g. in Campaign Monitor it'll look like this: text.0.text=[name, fallback=Tom] instead of Tom">text.0.text=<strong>[name, fallback=Tom]</strong></span>&<span class="highlighter" data-avia-tooltip="This defines our text position, in this case it's centered. You have full control over the position.">text.0.position=<strong>center</strong></span>&<span class="highlighter" data-avia-tooltip="Our text size.">text.0.size=<strong>30</strong></span>&<span class="highlighter" data-avia-tooltip="Text color in hex.">text.0.color=<strong>060606</strong></span>&<span class="highlighter" data-avia-tooltip="Font family. All Google fonts are available.">text.0.font.family=<strong>Caveat</strong></span></code>
   Let's break it down:
   <ul>
     <li><strong>https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Starbucks%202.jpg</strong> - this is the image URL. Nothing special here.</li>
     <li><strong>text.0.text</strong> - this parameter is responsible for the actual text. In our case, it's [name, fallback=Tom]. You can have 4 separate text overlays active at a time.</li>
     <li><strong>text.0.position</strong> - takes care of our text's position. We have it set to "center". You can position your text however you like, more in our <a href="https://sirv.com/help/resources/dynamic-imaging/#Text_overlays" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a>.</li>
     <li><strong>text.0.size</strong> - determines our text size in relative size to the image. </li>
     <li><strong>text.0.color</strong> - sets the color of our text.</li>
     <li><strong>text.0.font.family</strong> - used to set our font-family. It's Caveat in this case. You can use Google fonts here. </li>
   </ul>
   The best part is that you don't need to input these parameters into the URL by hand - Sirv has a powerful <a target="_blank" href="https://sirv.com/blog/image-customizer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image Customizer</a>, where you can style your overlay text and other elements in a visual manner.

   You're not limited to text overlays, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://sirv.com/help/resources/dynamic-imaging/#Watermark_overlays" rel="noopener noreferrer">add image overlays</a> and  <a target="_blank" href="https://sirv.com/help/resources/image-metadata/" rel="noopener noreferrer">use your image metadata</a>.
   <h3>What data to use in personalization</h3>

   For B2C you might want to collect:
   <ul>
   <li>Name</li>
   <li>Location</li>
   <li>Purchase history</li>
   <li>Demographic data</li>
   <li>Behavioral data</li>
   <li>Weather conditions</li>
   </ul>

   If you're short on data, you can always use data enrichment solutions to fill up this gap. <a target="_blank" href="https://clearbit.com/enrichment" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clearbit</a> is one of the most popular services for this. It can help you make  your forms shorter, further increasing your conversion rate.


  For B2B, demographic and behavioral data aren't as important.

   "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmographics" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firmographics</a>" are a much better thing to focus on. Here's what you can work with:

   <ul>
   <li>Website</li>
   <li>Industry</li>
   <li>Annual revenue</li>
   <li>Company size</li>
   <li>Location</li>
   <li>Stage in the sale cycle</li>
   </ul>

   Again, you can use Clearbit to automatically gather firmographic data. Afterwards, you can quite easily customize your automation sequences and increase your conversions.



   <h3 id="advanced">Advanced techniques</h3>
   Most marketers segment their users based on demographics or location and email them in bulk. Some combine behavioral and demographic data with machine learning to achieve maximum levels of personalization.

   A good example of this is <a href="https://www.booking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Booking.com</a>. You've probably experienced their marketing first-hand. It's enough to visit a single page to instantly get retargeted with their ads all over the place, but that's pretty basic dynamic remarketing.

   If you sign up for Booking.com, here's where they start bombarding you with emails based on your behavior and demographic data.
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="Booking.com personalized email example" src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/booking.png">
   <p class="wp-caption-text">A tidy list of deals, tailored to my interests.</p>
   </div>
   I did not express any interest in Sunny Beach or Krakow. But people similar to me did, so Booking.com's algorithms think that I'm likely to be interested in these locations. (While they weren't right in the Sunny Beach case, Krakow is definitely on my bucket list).

   Technically, the email is great. It's tidy and has deals.

   Compare it to <a href="http://airbnb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AirBNB's</a> email below.
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
   <img alt="AirBNB personalized email example" src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Airbnb.png">
   <p class="wp-caption-text">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://reallygoodemails.com/wp-content/uploads/coastal-bike-rides-now-on-airbnb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full email here</a></p>
   </div>
   Crisp imagery, great typography and genuinely interesting content. In my eyes, this is a significant upgrade compared to Booking.com's email.


   Let's move on to our second use-case - landing pages.

   <h2 id="landing">Personalized images on landing pages</h2>
   <div class="full-image__container marginize">
    <div class="full-image--center">
   <img alt="Personalized Images on landing pages" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/Landing_page_section2x.png?w=1600">
    </div>
    </div>
   Landing page personalization is one of my favorite techniques ever. Personalized landing pages improve conversions, which means more leads and more bang for the buck on your ad spend.
   <blockquote>
   ‚ÄúOn your first-ever visit to the site, we could show you something that would resonate with you. That was the holy grail and it actually worked. This is a huge competitive advantage for us.‚Äù
    - John Ewing, BMI Research
   </blockquote>

   There are several ways to personalize your landing pages:

   <ul>
   <li>Personalization by context: use URL parameters to detect ad keywords, campaign sources or anything you can think of. Then change the landing page content accordingly.</li>
   <li>Personalization by live data: grab location, business name and other firmographics with external services and use this data to personalize the landing page. </li>
   </ul>

   Here are some interesting examples that were proven to increase conversions.

   <h3 id="referrer">Referrer based personalization</h3>
   One of the most common techniques is to use the Campaign Source to personalize your landing page content. This way you can show different copy or design elements to people coming from different campaigns.

   Here's what Obama did for people coming from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.
  <div class="marginize">
   <img class="Sirv" alt="Obama reddit AMA landing page example" data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/obama_does_an_ama.png.jpg">
</div>
   If you ever visited ProductHunt or HackerNews, you'll often see this tactic used.
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
    <img class="Sirv" alt="Owox Product Hunt callout example" data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/owox_ph.png">
    <p class="wp-caption-text">Owox used a huge call-out for people who came from ProductHunt</p>
</div>
   It's not really hard to pull off and can help you increase conversions dramatically.

   If you've ever noticed Intercom's chat widget, you've probably seen that they include a "powered by Intercom" link. If you click it, you'll see a page like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intercom.com/intercom-link?company=Atlantic%20Global%20Asset%20Management&solution=live-chat" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>:
   <div class="marginize" style="max-width:800px;">
   <img alt="Intercom personalized referrer landing page" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/intercom_referrer_modified.png">
   </div>

   They grab the "company" parameter's value and insert it into the page dynamically. They also show a stylish illustration and selected product features based on their second URL parameter - "solution".

   This tactic can be used for literally anything you can pass in the URL.

   However, make sure you have full control over how your URLs are generated, to avoid unwanted results like this:
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
     <img alt="Intercom landing page humor attempt" src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/intercom_lol.png">
     <p class="wp-caption-text">It's totally fabricated. But you get the point.</p>
   </div>
   <h3 id="dki">Dynamic keyword insertion</h3>
   Provided out-of-the box in <s>AdWords</s> Google and Bing ads, dynamic keyword insertion has proven itself to boost conversion rates and landing page quality scores. You're basically dynamically changing your landing page elements based on search keywords.

   Look how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/convert-your-ad-traffic-with-personalized-landing-pages/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercom personalizes</a> its landing pages based on ad content. A whopping <strong>300% conversion rate increase</strong> was surely worth the work they put into this.
   <div class="marginize" style="max-width: 800px;">
   <img alt="DKI INtercom landing page examples"class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/Intercom.png">
   </div>
   Be careful not to use Dynamic Keyword Insertion for broad match keywords, you may end up looking silly and ultimately hurting your conversion rate.  It's a safe bet to customize your landing pages based on Campaign and ad group.

   <h3 id="location-personalization">Personalization by location</h3>
   Customer's location can be crucial for some businesses. It makes sense that people in Chile and in British Columbia are different.

   Nationwide Insurance experimented with their landing page, serving a different version for people from cold regions.
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
     <img class="Sirv" alt="Nationwide insurance landing page example. Before."data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/VersionAlg81.jpg">
   <p class="wp-caption-text">Before</p>
   </div>
   <div class="wp-caption aligncenter">
     <img class="Sirv" alt="Nationwide insurance landing page example. After." data-src="https://sirv-cdn.sirv.com/blog/Personalization/examples/VersionBlg81.jpg">
   <p class="wp-caption-text">After</p>
   </div>
   I'd argue that the "snowy" version is just better all around with its nicer contrast, a smiling girl and other subtle changes, regardless it performed much better in colder regions, where it was served. It's easier for people to receive your message if they can relate to it visually.

   <!-- <h3>Personalization by firmographics</h3> -->

   <h2 style="text-align:center;" id="banners" data-toc-title="Personalized banners">Personalized banners</h2>
<div class="full-image__container marginize">
      <div class="full-image--center">
          <img alt="personalized banners" class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/blog/Banner_section%402x.png?text.0.text=Tom%2C%20your%20new%20home%0Ais%20waiting&text.0.position.x=20%&text.0.position.y=35%&text.0.position.gravity=northwest&text.0.size=30&text.0.color=327bba&w=1600&text.0.font.family=Raleway">
      </div>
      </div>

   When it comes to the most commonly used personalization format, banners lead the way.

   This is because email is the most widely used personalization channel.

   It doesn't mean that banners are limited to email only. You can use them on landing pages, pop-ups and chat bots.

   We've created some examples using Sirv to show you what's possible.

   <h3 id="simple-banner">Simple banner with an overlay</h3>

   Using someone's name together with a call-to-action can yield a <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data#sm.000awoxgniktcoi11jl2et1nit4os" rel="noopener noreferrer">42% higher view-to-submission rate</a> compared to generic CTAs:
