HelloðŸ‘‹, thanks for stopping by. My name is Igor Varyvoda and I enjoy marketing, coding and writing.

I'm currently working as a Digital Strategist at [Sirv](https://sirv.com), an image management, manipulation and delivery platform. I help businesses optimize their visual content, improve site performance, and enhance user experiences.

## What I Do

My day job is marketing, but on the side I love building fun projects and tools that solve my own problems. From AI-powered finance trackers to interactive travel bots, I turn ideas into working products. Check out my [projects](/projects/) to see what I've been tinkering with.

I also share insights about e-commerce, SEO, and web optimization on my [blog](/posts/). Topics range from increasing Shopify sales to technical deep-dives on image optimization and web performance.

## Tech Stack

I work primarily with Vue.js, Nuxt, Python, Go, and modern web technologies. I'm particularly interested in AI integration, image optimization, and building tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

Feel free to [get in touch](/contact/) or check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/igorvaryvoda/).
